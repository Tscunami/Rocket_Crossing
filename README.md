# Rocket crossing game

Whole project is visible on:
- https://repl.it/join/hvmtpbrc-luknplava

Description:
- Don't run this game on replit.it, instead of it, download the rocket-crossing.zip and run it in any IDE (I recommend Pycharm)
    - There are a lot of animations and it doesn't run smooth in web browser
- Game is similar as well the known game Crossy Road, where you control animal which tries to go as far as it can
- In rocket crossing game you control a small rocket ship, which you control with Up arrow
- Further you get, faster are flying objects, so difficulty increase

Do you beat level 10?
